### Overview  
**CLAVIRA** is an innovative environmental project developed as part of the **Tuwaiq Academy ‚Äì Operating Drones with Artificial Intelligence Algorithms** program.  
The project explores how **drones combined with computer vision (YOLOv11)** can detect and classify trash across desert environments, promoting sustainability and ecosystem protection.

Human activities such as tourism, camping, and transportation in deserts often lead to **littering**, leaving behind plastics, cans, and bottles that persist for decades. Due to the **vast and hard-to-monitor** nature of deserts, manual detection is nearly impossible.  
CLAVIRA provides an **AI-powered solution** to automate waste detection and mapping, supporting targeted cleanup and environmental conservation efforts.

## üåç Problem Statement
- Trash in deserts is scattered, often half-buried by sand, and hard to locate.  
- Remote desert areas **lack structured waste management systems**.  
- Accumulated litter **pollutes ecosystems, harms wildlife,** and contributes to **climate change** through greenhouse gas emissions.

## üí° Our Solution
**CLAVIRA** combines drone technology with **YOLOv11**, an advanced AI vision model, to identify and classify waste in real time.

### üõ† How It Works
1. **Drone Flight:** Drones capture aerial images and videos of desert environments.  
2. **Image Processing:** Visual data is pre-processed for optimal model input.  
3. **AI Detection:** The YOLOv11 model identifies and classifies waste (e.g., bottles, cans, plastics).  
4. **Actionable Insights:** Enables **targeted cleanup operations** and supports conservation initiatives.
