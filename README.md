# Overview

This project was developed as part of the Tuwaiq Academy â€“ Operating Drones with Artificial Intelligence Algorithms program. It explores how drones combined with computer vision (YOLOv11) can be used to detect and classify waste in desert environments.

- Drones capture aerial images of desert areas.

- A YOLOv11 model identifies and classifies scattered waste in real time.

- Enables targeted cleanup operations and environmental conservation efforts.

# ðŸŽ¯ Future Work
- Autonomous Collection: Integrate ground robots with drones for automated waste retrieval.

- Policy & Community Engagement: Collaborate with governments and NGOs to scale impact.

- Advanced Classification: Expand dataset for multi-class waste recognition and improved accuracy.
